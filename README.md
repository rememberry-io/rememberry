Flashcards provide an effective way to memorise stuff using active recall and spaced repetition. Creating them manually in Anki can be painful - this script should help by pasting in the contents into appropriate sheet columns and let the upload and creation happening automatically in the background.  

# Blueprint 🔨
- Nuxt3 -> UI
- PapaParse -> Parsing CSV data
- GSheets/Excel -> storing flashcard data as CSV
- AnkiConnect/Anki API -> creating and storing flashcards (see here: https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect/)
